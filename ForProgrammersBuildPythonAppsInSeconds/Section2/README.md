You can generate not only text with ChatGPT, but also SVG vector images. You can use such images in your desktop or web apps. To generate a vector image with ChatGPT, please follow these steps:

1.  Write a query similar to this example "Generate SVG code for a Python logo."
2. Copy the generated code and paste it inside an empty text file.
3. Save the text file using a .svg extension (e.g., python.svg).
4. Double-clicking the file should show the image (e.g., a Python logo).

For more richer images, you can use any of the AI image generators below:
