"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it." - Charles R. Swindoll
"Believe you can and you're halfway there." - Theodore Roosevelt

I want to create a web app that displays one of the quotest of the "quotes.txt" file whenever 
the web app is visited. Write the web app using Flask and Python.
