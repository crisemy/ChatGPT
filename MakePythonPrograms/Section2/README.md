Using ChatGPT for File and Data Automations

## ChatGPT Request > Ex10 > Streamline Excel Processing with ChatGPT
I have multiple Excel files in a folder named "excel_files". Each excel file contains two columns,
and "employee" column and a "monthly salary" column. I want to add a new "annual salary" column to
each Excel file. The "annual salary" column should be equal to "monthly salary" x 12.
Write me a Python script for that.

NOTE: Needs to get Panda installed to run the Python script. 
It should ask for other extension but it's a matter of installing it 'n that's it.

## ChatGPT Request > Ex13 > Merging Excel Files with ChatGPT
I have multiple files in a directory named "excel_files". 
They all contain the same columns. 
I want to merge the excel files into one single Excel file containing the data of all the files. 
Write me a Python script for that.

## ChatGPT Request > Ex14 > Processing CSV Files in Bulk with ChatGPT
I have a "stockholm.csv" file. The file has a TG column. I want to divide all values 
of that column by 10. Write me a Python script for that.

## ChatGPT Request > Ex15 > Rule-Based ZIP Generation with ChatGPT
I have 400 text files in a directory named "text_files. File names are named like "TG_STAID000001.txt", 
"TG_STAID000002.txt" and so on. File names have a number before the .txt extension. 
The number is important. I want to place those files in one separate ZIP file. 
Those ZIP files should be allocated at the "ZIP_files" folder. Files with numbers 1 to 10 should be inside a ZIP file. 
Numbers 11 to 20 should be inside another ZIP file and so on. So, the number before the .txt extension is very important. 
Write me a Python script for that.
